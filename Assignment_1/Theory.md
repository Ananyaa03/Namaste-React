- Loads the script **asynchronously** while HTML continues parsing.
- Executes **immediately after the script is downloaded**, possibly **before HTML is fully parsed**.
- **Use Case:** Scripts that donâ€™t depend on or affect the DOM structure (e.g., analytics).

```html
<script src="script.js" async></script>
```

### ðŸ”¹ `defer`

- Loads the script **asynchronously**, like `async`.
- **Defers execution** until **after the HTML is fully parsed**.
- Ensures the script runs **only when the DOM is ready**.
- **Use Case:** Scripts that interact with or manipulate DOM elements.

```html
<script src="script.js" defer></script>
```
