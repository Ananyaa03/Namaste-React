**1. What is Emmet?**

Ans: 

Emmet is **a web development toolkit and a plugin for code editors that significantly speeds up writing HTML and CSS**. It allows developers to use abbreviations that are then expanded into full code structures, saving time and effort. 

**2. Difference between a Library and Framework?**

Ans: 

**A library is a collection of reusable code that provides specific functionalities, and the developer is in control, calling the library's functions as needed.** 

**A framework is a more structured environment that dictates the overall application flow and architecture, and it often calls the developer's code to fill in the details (inversion of control)**. 

**3.  What is CDN? Why do we use it?**

Ans:

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is **a geographically distributed network of servers that work together to speed up the delivery of web content to users**.

**4.  Why is React known as React?**

Ans:

React is named "React" **because of its core functionality: it reacts to changes in data by efficiently updating the user interface (UI)**. When data within a React application changes, the components that rely on that data are automatically re-rendered, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

**5. What is cross origin in script tag?**

Ans:

A cross-origin request is **a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain**.

**6.  What is difference between React and React DOM?**

Ans:

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, while React DOM is a separate package that provides methods for rendering React components into the browser's Document Object Model (DOM).

7.  **What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?**

Ans:

### `react.development.js`

This version is for development and includes detailed error messages and warnings. It helps developers catch bugs but is slower and larger in size.

### `react.production.js`

This version is optimized for production use — it's smaller, faster, and stripped of debug information. Use it when deploying your app to users for best performance.

**8. What is async and defer?**

Ans:

`async` and `defer` are **HTML attributes** used with `<script>` tags to control **when and how JavaScript files are loaded and executed** in a web page.

---

### ✅ `async`

- **Loads the script asynchronously** while the HTML continues parsing.
- **Executes the script immediately after it's downloaded**, possibly before HTML parsing is complete.
- **Use Case:** Scripts that don’t depend on or affect the DOM structure (e.g. analytics).

```html
html
CopyEdit
<script src="script.js" async></script>
```

---

### ✅ `defer`

- **Loads the script asynchronously** like `async`, but...
- **Defers execution** until **after the HTML is fully parsed**.
- **Use Case:** Scripts that interact with DOM elements.

```html
html
CopyEdit
<script src="script.js" defer></script>
```
